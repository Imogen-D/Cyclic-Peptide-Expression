Scripts and outline of transcript analysis on Epichloe species. Cyclic Peptide Orthologs used as example dataset.

Transcipt data given in nuc/ files

RNA data given by D. Winter, from in planta Epichloe. Plant transcripts removed.

Salmon (https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#using-salmon) used for transcript quanitification

Expression of orthologs associated with cyclic peptide production in 5 strains of Epichloe with RNAseq data was analysed and statistically presented
